JavaScript Shopping Cart app Instructions

Create a simple shopping cart application using basic JavaScript. Please create a GitHub repo and push your solution, then submit the repo URL.:

1. Create an HTML file named MyShoppingCart.
2. Create a JavaScript file named myscript.
3. Add a heading in the HTML file that says "My Shopping Cart".
4. Create a link to your JS file in the HTML document.
5. Ask the user to input their name.
6. Ask the user to input 3 product names and their 3 product prices (you will need 3 prompts for the product names and 3 prompts for the prices)
7. Use a conditional statement to determine if the price for first product is 0, then tell the user the price can't be 0 and to enter a valid price. In the real world you would check all prices, but for brevity we are only checking the first one. 
8. Calculate the subtotal of the items by adding them together.
9. Log the subtotal to the console.
10. Calculate the grand total by adding a tax of 6.25%
11. Display the message "customerName, your grand total is: $grandTotal" to the console.

You may add HTML and create CSS. However, you will only be graded on your JavaScript.

Tips: 

* Use pseudocode to help you with creating a blueprint of the app before you start writing and JavaScript. 
* Store the different prompts into variables. 
* Think about when you should use let or const.
* Use descriptive variable names: e.g. product1Name
* Remember to use Number(), and be thoughtful about where to use it (when you store the prompt to a variable or when you perform calculations? which is more efficient?)
